# STEPS:
# Begin by checking if the click location is the same as the mine location. (Edge case)
# update it to 'X', and return.
# add the first mine location to the queue.
# Begin by processing its neighbors
# count whether any of its 8 neighbors have a mine.
# update the cell location to blank if no mine found in its neighbors, and add its neighbors to the queue.
# update this cell value to "B"
# if mines are present in the neighbors, update the cell value to the count.
# return the board when the queue is empty.
# Time complexity - O(nm)
# Space complexity - O(nm) -- queue
# did this solution run on leetcode? - yes
